# OncoVue 🔬
**AI-Enhanced Radiology Image Analysis for Multicancer Detection**

OncoVue is a deep learning-powered system that analyzes radiological CT scan images for early and accurate multicancer detection. It automates the diagnostic process using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and advanced computer vision techniques, aiming to assist radiologists with precision, efficiency, and standardization.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Early diagnosis is key to successful cancer treatment. However, manual interpretation of CT scans can be time-consuming and prone to human error. OncoVue addresses this issue by automating the image analysis process using AI.

The system follows a modular pipeline:
1. **Data Acquisition**
2. **Image Preprocessing**
3. **ROI Segmentation**
4. **Feature Extraction**
5. **Classification (CNN)**
6. **Result Visualization**

## 🧠 Features

- **Deep Learning (CNN - ResNet-50)** based classification
- **Edge detection & thresholding** for ROI segmentation
- **Multi-cancer detection** from CT scans
- **DICOM integration** for CT scanner communication
- **Secure & scalable architecture**
- **User-friendly GUI** for radiologists
- **Transfer learning** to reduce training time and increase accuracy

## 📊 Methodology

### 🖼️ 1. Data Acquisition
- Collect CT scan images from hospitals or open datasets.
- Ensure anonymization and compliance with data privacy.

### 🧹 2. Pre-processing
- Noise reduction, artifact removal
- Image intensity standardization
- Augmentation (rotation, flipping)

### 🔍 3. Segmentation
- Identify Regions of Interest (ROIs) using edge detection and thresholding
- Advanced options: U-Net for precise segmentation

### 🧬 4. Feature Extraction
- Geometric features: size, shape, texture, intensity
- Spatial relationships between ROIs

### 🧠 5. Classification
- Use of **ResNet-50** with transfer learning for cancer type prediction
- Fine-tuned for binary (cancerous / non-cancerous) or multi-class (cancer types) classification

### 📈 6. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Sensitivity & Specificity
- Area Under ROC Curve (AUC)
